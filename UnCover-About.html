  <p> Uncover is a digital book swapping service that helps connect book owners
      who are interested in trading their used books with other book owners' used books.
      It's a win-win because everyone gets to enjoy a new book without needing to spend the extra cash making
      more space at home to store old books.
      The trick is that the titles and covers are hidden, so what you get in the mail is a mystery</p>

  <br>
  <h2> How does it work</h2>
  <br>
  <p> It's easy in these 5 steps
    <ol>
      <li> List books you'd like to swap with other club members.</li>
      <li> Once a book is requested, mail it to the club member.
           You pay postage for the books you send out</li>
      <li> In return, you can choose from 1,511,933 available books!
           the books you receive come to you postage-paid.</li>
      <li> Books you request are yours to keep, or swap again!</li>
