  <h2> What is Uncover</h2>

  <p> Uncover is a digital book swapping service that helps connect book owners</br>
      who are interested in trading their used books with other book owners' used books.</br>
      It's a win-win because everyone gets to enjoy a new book without needing to spend the extra cash making </br>
      more space at home to store old books.</br>
      The trick is that the titles and covers are hidden, so what you get in the mail is a mystery</br></p>
