  <h2> What is Uncover</h2>

  <p> Uncover is a digital book swapping service that helps connect book owners</br>
      who are interested in trading their used books with other book owners' used books.</br>
      It's a win-win because everyone gets to enjoy a new book without needing to spend the extra cash. </br>
      Another bonus is that it helps to create more space at home to store old books.</br>
      But there is a catch! Unlike the titles or covers you can see above, the trick is that the titles and covers are hidden,</br> 
      so what you get in the mail is a mystery!</br></p>

  <h2> How it works</h2>
  <p> It's easy in these 5 steps </p>
    <ol>
      <li> List books you'd like to swap with other club members.</li>
      <li> Once a book is requested, mail it to the club member.
           You pay postage for the books you send out</li>
      <li> In return, you can choose from lots of other available books!
           The books you receive come to you postage-paid.</li>
      <li> Whilst books you request are yours to keep, or swap again!</li>
    </ol>
